###Notes

1. This repo is a Eclipse project developed under MacOS X, Eclipse Kepler and JavaSE-1.6, you can download the whole project and directly import to your Eclipse, shouldn't occur any problems. If it is, check your OS, Java installation and Eclipse release.

2. The code is explained itself, so yes, READ THE DAMN CODE.

3. In current version, raw data processing is not elegant at all (but good enough to work in most cases). In future, this part should be changed completely to support more language phenomenon (e.x. Math equations, Unicode characters) [We consider ASC II characters now]
